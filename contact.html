If your shoulders are tight and you want more leverage, try holding the sides of your yoga mat and lifting your hips. You may also wish to interlace your fingers underneath your “bridge” and shimmy your shoulders under the chest.

When you’re ready to come down, lift your heels up and slowly lower your hips back to the ground, one vertebra at a time.

<p class='ridge'>How to do it<br><br>
Start in Downward-Facing Dog, facing the wall. Place your hands 6 inches from the wall. Bend one knee and step the foot in toward the wall. Lift the other leg into the air.

When you’re just getting used to being upside down, you may feel the most comfortable hopping off the bottom foot to kick the lifted leg up toward the wall. Others rely on core strength to bring both the legs up. Either way, bring your feet together against the wall.

To come out of the pose, bend your knees and use your core to slowly draw your legs down to the ground. After an inversion, take a few moments to readjust before returning to your practice.
<br><br>
The benefits<br><br>
This energizing inversion strengthens your shoulders, arms, and wrists. It helps to promote a sense of balance, confidence, and calm.</p>

Start on all fours, with your head facing the direction of the wall. Place your elbows on the floor and come down to your forearms.

Bring them parallel to one other, shoulder-width apart. Tuck your toes, lift knees, and reach hips up and back into Dolphin Pose.

Broaden across the chest and gaze at the floor between your forearms. Step one foot in a few inches. Lift the other leg up and straight back.

Bend the knee of your grounded leg. Hop off that foot and send both feet up to the wall. Squeeze your inner thighs together and reach heels up toward the ceiling.

To come out of the pose, bend your knees and use your core to bring your feet down to the ground. Take a few moments to relax before returning to your practice.

The benefits<br><br>
This is a deep shoulder opener, making it a great preparatory pose for backbends. As an inversion, it also helps improve circulation.</p>

Warning: If you have neck injuries or medical issues, check with your doctor before attempting this pose. This pose is not appropriate for all practitioners and is best practiced under the watchful eye of a trusted teacher.

Start on all fours facing the wall. Interlace your fingers with your knuckles facing the wall. Place elbows on the floor shoulder-width apart. Place the crown of your head on the floor into the basket created by your interlaced fingers.

Tuck your toes under, lift knees off the floor, and reach your hips up and back. Press down into your forearms and lift up through shoulders.

Walk your feet in closer as you broaden across the chest. Most of the weight should be concentrated in your forearms.

Draw your knees into the chest with control, place your feet on the wall, and slide heels up the wall simultaneously. Reach up through your legs.

Come out of the pose with control, maintaining the lift of your shoulders.

The benefits<br><br>

Neatly stack two blankets with the folded edges aligned with the short edge of your mat. Lay on the blankets and place the tops of your shoulders 2 inches from the edge of the blankets.
