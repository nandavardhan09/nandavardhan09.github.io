</div>

<div>
<p class='ridge'>How to do it<br><br>
Place your hands on the back of a chair with palms shoulder-distance apart. Step your feet back until they align under hips, creating a right angle with your body, spine parallel with the floor.

Ground through your feet and lift through thighs. Reach hips away from hands to lengthen the sides of your torso. Firm your outer arms in and lengthen through the crown of your head.
<br><br>
The benefits<br><br>
Downward-Facing Dog is the bread and butter of yoga, but it can be challenging for beginners.

This modification shares the same benefits as the classic pose — stretching the hamstrings, opening the shoulders, and creating length in the spine — without all the weight on your upper body.</p>

<div>
<p class='ridge'>How to do it<br>From all fours, walk your hands 6 inches in front of you. Tuck your toes and lift your hips up and back to lengthen your spine. If your hamstrings are tight, keep your knees bent in order to bring your weight back into the legs.

Spread your fingers wide, press into your hands, and rotate your arms so that your biceps are facing toward one another. Press your thighs back toward the wall behind you.<br><br>The Benefits<br>This classic pose opens your shoulders, lengthens your spine, and stretches your hamstrings. Since your head is below your heart, the mild inversion creates a calming effect.</p>

<h4>5. Warrior II</h4>

</div>

<div>
<p class='ridge'>How to do it<br>
Stand with feet wide, 3–4 feet apart. Shift your right heel out so your toes are pointing slightly inward. Turn your left foot out 90 degrees. Line up your left heel with the arch of your right foot.

Bend your left knee to a 90-degree angle, keeping the knee in line with the second toe to protect the knee joint. Stretch through your straight back leg and ground down into the back foot.

On an inhale, bring arms to a T at shoulder height. Draw your shoulder blades down the back. Spread your fingers and keep palms facedown. Gaze over the front fingers. As you exhale, sink deeper into the stretch.

Pro tip: To draw your shoulder blades down the back, rotate your palms face-up. Notice how that shifts your shoulders. Once settled, rotate your palms facedown.
<br><br>
The benefits<br>
A pose with “warrior” in its name may not sound very zen, but this standing pose can help calm and steady your mind. Tougher than it looks, it also strengthens your legs and ankles while increasing stamina.</p>

<br><br>
The benefits<br>

</div>

<p class='ridge'>How to do it<br>

As you exhale, ground through the standing leg and lengthen through the crown of your head. Bring your palms to touch in front of your sternum into prayer hands.

<h4>8. Bridge Pose</h4>
<div style='height: 360px; width: 360px; background-color: voilet'>

<img style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain' src="/yoga/008.jpg"> 
</div>

<div>
<p class='ridge'>How to do it<br>
Lie faceup with knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and arms at your sides with palms facedown. Keep your feet parallel and hip-width apart, heels stacked under knees.

On an inhale, activate through the legs and the glutes. Press the floor away with your feet and lift the hips off the floor toward the sky.

If your shoulders are tight and you want more leverage, try holding the sides of your yoga mat and lifting your hips. You may also wish to interlace your fingers underneath your “bridge” and shimmy your shoulders under the chest.

When you’re ready to come down, lift your heels up and slowly lower your hips back to the ground, one vertebra at a time.

Pro tip: To keep your knees from bowing out to the side, place a block between the upper thighs. Squeeze it tight as you lift up into Bridge Pose.

The benefits
<br>This energizing backbend opens your chest and stretches your neck and spine. It can calm the mind, reduce anxiety, and help improve digestion.</p>

Start in Downward-Facing Dog. Shift forward so your shoulders are stacked over your wrists. Draw your navel in toward your spine and keep your hips from dropping.

<br>
Pro tip: Come down to your knees if the pose is too intense.

</div>

<div>
<p class='ridge'>How to do it<br>
From Plank Pose, shift forward onto your tippy toes. Ground through your palms and broaden across the chest. Take an inhale.

On an exhale, bend your elbows to a 90-degree angle. Keep your thighs lifted toward the ceiling. Imagine stretching your tailbone toward your heels as you lengthen through the spine. Hold your elbows in line with the torso. Gaze forward.

To come out of the pose, release your knees to the ground. You can also keep your knees lifted and lower down onto your stomach for an extra ab challenge. Another option is to lift up and back to a Downward-Facing Dog and relax.
<br>
The benefits
<br>Chaturanga is a key part of Sun Salutations, which you’ll find in Hatha, Sivananda, Ashtanga, and Vinyasa yoga classes. It promotes core stability and strengthens your abdominals and triceps.</p>
