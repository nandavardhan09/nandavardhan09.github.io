<h1>DIET PLANS</h1>






<h2>WEIGHT LOSS</h2><p class='ridge'>
A low fat diet, as the name implies, is a dietary pattern that limits the fat intake at about 1/3 of the total daily calories consumed. It consists of little fat, particularly saturated fats and cholesterol which lead to increased blood cholesterol levels and heart attack.

<br>This type of diet plan to reduce obesity focuses on foods that contain whole grains, fruits and vegetables. It is directed towards weight loss and treatment of certain diseases by offering 20 to 30 percent of total daily calories from fat. Plenty of vegetables and proteins in a typical low fat diet supply the body with energy but very little fats.

<br>However, fats should not be eliminated entirely as some dietary fat is needed for good health, supplying energy and fat soluble vitamins like A, D, E and K. Studies have revealed that the right kinds of fats can actually help in losing weight. Hence, the prime focus of healthy diet plan for obesity is on limiting the unhealthy fats and consumption of right amounts of fats.

<br>Low-fat diets have been promoted for the prevention of heart disease. Lowering fat intake from 35-40% of total calories to 15-20% of total calories has been shown to decrease total and LDL cholesterol by 10 to 20%; however, most of this decrease is due to a reduction in saturated fat intake.

<br>We create an Indian diet chart for people facing obesity. Follow this diet plan and start eating those food items which listed in breakfast, lunch and dinner timings.</p>

<br><h3>Food Items You Can Easily Consume in Underweight Diet Plan</h3>
Lean Red Meat: Steak contains a ton of protein and iron. Red meat is high in cholesterol, so most food professionals don’t recommend it as part of a healthy diet more than a few times per week.
<br>Real Nut Butters: Natural peanut butter is packed with protein and fats, making it a great choice for people trying to gain weight the healthy way. One tablespoon contains around 100 calories and has 4 grams of protein.
<br>Whole Fat Milk: Dietitians say that one simple substitution you can make when trying to gain weight is swapping your skim milk for whole milk. It’s only 60 calories more a glass as the fat is left in.
<br>Tropical Fruit: Fruits like mango, papaya, bananas, and pineapple are amazing choices according to food experts. They are full of natural sugars and can give you great energy.
<br>Avocado: These delicious green vegetables are an excellent way to add heart-healthy fats to your diet. One half of an avocado contains 140 calories, but also contain high levels of potassium, folic acid, and vitamin E.
<br>Natural Granola: Natural granola with no added refined sugar is a great cereal to enjoy if you are trying to gain weight. This tasty snack is made from rolled oats, sugar, and healthy fats (like nuts and coconut oil). More dried fruit and nuts can also be added.
<br>Whole Wheat Bread: Nutritionists say that eating healthy bread products is a great way to start gaining weight. If you’re adding bread to your diet, look for whole grains. Nuts: Nuts are a great snack for gaining weight. They are full of fat and nutrients, but also contain a great deal of fiber. Eating only a handful of nuts can keep you full for hours. Not all nuts are equal for fiber though.
<br>Cheese: Try goat cheese with eggs, Swiss with roasted chicken, and Parmesan on top of asparagus. On its own, cheese also makes a great snack because it’s high in protein.</p>
